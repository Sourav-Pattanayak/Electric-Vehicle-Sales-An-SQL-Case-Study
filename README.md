📊 Project Summary 🚀

In this project, we've unearthed invaluable insights that can turbocharge our business growth and progress tracking, utilizing SQL for robust data analysis. Here's a quick overview of what we've achieved:

💰 Revenue Breakdown:
- In 2016, our Sprint Scooter model raked in a whopping $56.25 million, accounting for 30.3% of all electric vehicle scooter sales, with data extracted using SQL.

📈 Sales Highlights:
- September 2016 witnessed our highest monthly sales revenue, soaring to $100.05 million, as reported in our SQL-generated data analysis.
- Our very first Sprint Scooter was sold on October 10, 2016, starting at $95,998. Please refer to the attached SQL file for the code section related to initial sales data.
- During the initial 7 days (Oct 10 - Oct 16, 2016), we moved a total of 107 units, as recorded in our SQL database.
- On October 20, 2016, Corpel automobiles saw a cumulative sales volume of 6 units in the last 7 days, with details sourced from our SQL records.
- The peak sales day was June 8, 2018, with 49 units sold, as confirmed through SQL analysis.

📧 Email Insights:
- The email subject "Save the Planet with some Holiday Savings" garnered the highest open count, with a staggering 9,415 opens, as documented in our SQL-generated email metrics.
- Customer 25031 took the crown for opening the most emails, with a remarkable 10 opens, a fact captured through SQL data extraction.
- On average, customers took around 418.30 days to make their second purchase, a statistic derived from our SQL analysis.

🔝 Customer Analysis:
- We identified the top 3 customers with the most opened emails for each product model, utilizing SQL to generate this customer insight.
- Highlighted the top 5 customers who not only opened the most emails but also made purchases, showcasing their counts and purchase amounts, with data sourced from our SQL database.

📫 Email Metrics:
- Calculated bounce rates for each email subject, focusing on emails sent to customers who made a purchase, using SQL to process this email data.
- Determined the click-through rates (CTR) for the top 2 email advertisement subjects, with "25% off all EVs. It's a Christmas Time" reigning supreme with the highest CTR at 2.39%, as derived from SQL-based email metrics.

This comprehensive project has equipped us with actionable insights to propel our business to new heights, all backed by the power of SQL data analysis. 🚗💼💡 Please refer to the attached SQL file for the code sections related to our data analysis.
